# Guillaume Plique

Research engineer for SciencesPo [médialab](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/).

Assisting social science researchers by:

- Designing digital methodologies
- Collecting massive amount of data on the web
- Performing analysis of said data
- Maintaining Open Source apps, tools & libraries

# SciencesPo médialab

Founded by Bruno Latour, directed by Dominique Cardon

Based on the following triangle:

- Social science researchers
- Designers
- Engineers

# Who are you?

1. Did you attend Rubing Chen's classes prev. semester?
2. Are some of you completely new to python?
3. Which languages do you speak/understand?
4. What computer/OS are you usign?
5. How did you install Python?
6. Research-oriented? Knowledge of social sciences methodology?

# A special kind of course

This course is mostly a blank slate:

- First time it is given at PSIA (and SciencesPo)
- Unknown and heterogeneous level of students
- Small numbers = practical work + individual coaching

---

# A more conceptual approach

You could learn python strictly in a means-to-an-end approach.

I prefer give you some context and broader knowledge of what programming is, along with related concepts.

Some things we will learn might not seem directly useful to you but will be in the long run.

---

# Broader topics

We **will** talk about:

- Computer history
- Computer sciences
- Algorithmic complexity
- How Internet actually works
- etc.

---

# Entonces

Course should be packed, but:

* Feel free to ask questions
* We leave nobody behind
* We tailor the course's pace on group level
* If level is too disparate, we fork
* I should have enough time to help you individually

# What today is about

- Python language basics review
- A first use-case about PRNGs
- Level assessment
- Shaping future courses outline

---

# Checking python setups

You can, depending on your OS and python setup:

- Working by executing scripts (might be complicated on windows)
- Working on Jupyter notebooks
- Conda? Pyenv?
- Knowledge of unix shells?

# For next time

Find a interesting (to you) social topic that is discussed on the web and on social networks (Twitter mostly).

First foreshadowing warning about web data:

- Keep in mind that some sources are preferred over others for technical, not epistemological, reasons
- Web platforms are used in a specific way
- Web data collection has advantages over traditional ones but also has its own biases
