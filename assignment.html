<h1 id="final-assignment">Final assignment</h1>
<p>Deadline: may the 7th (sunday), at 11:59pm CEST</p>
<p>Send your Jupyter notebook file by email (it should have the <code>.ipynb</code> extension).</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to have the following dependencies installed: <code>minet==1.0.0-a15</code>, <code>ural</code>.</li>
<li>Using minet (relevant documentation <a href="https://github.com/medialab/minet/blob/master/docs/twitter.md">here</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/medialab/minet/blob/master/docs/cli.md#twitter-scrape">here</a> if you feel you want to use the CLI version), collect some relevant amount of tweets related to some social/political subject that feels interesting to you.</li>
<li>Find the top tweet by number of retweets and display its text, its author&#39;s screen name and its number of retweets.</li>
<li>Find the 10 accounts that tweeted the most in our corpus (you should rely on the <code>user_screen_name</code> key).</li>
<li>Find the 10 most influent accounts by total number of retweets in our corpus.</li>
<li>For nonzero values, compute descriptive statistics (min, max, mean, median, stdev) of the numbers of retweets in our corpus (python has a dedicated <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html"><code>statistics</code></a> module for this).</li>
<li>Write a csv file using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter"><code>csv.DictWriter</code></a> with two columns <code>url</code> and <code>count</code>, containing all the shared urls along with the number of times they were shared in our corpus (using the <code>links</code> key, containing the urls shared by a single tweet).</li>
<li>Find the 10 most shared urls or domains or any units of a url that feels relevant to you in the context of your analysis (you might want to rely on functions provided by <a href="https://github.com/medialab/ural">ural</a> for this).</li>
<li>Find the 25 most used hashtags (check out the <code>hashtags</code> key).</li>
<li>Run your own analysis, using basic statistics and/or networks to explore the dataset and redact a concise paragraph to explain what you understood of the collected data through said analysis.</li>
</ul>
